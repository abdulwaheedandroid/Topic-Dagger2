What is dependency?
If a class 'User' has an object of a class 'Address' that means User depends on Address. That further means User depends on Address and
Address is a dependency of User. It is a design pattern.
For example:
===========
Recycler view needs an adapter to create single rows so Adapter is a dependency of RecyclerView.
